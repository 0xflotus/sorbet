*************************************

Welcome to Sorbet!

This script will create a `./sorbet/` directory with:
* `sorbet/config` :                Default options to passed to sorbet on every run
* `sorbet/rbi/sorbet-typed/`       Community writen type definition files for your gems
* `sorbet/rbi/gems/`               Autogenerated type definitions for your gems using reflection
* `sorbet/rbi/hidden-definitions/` An encoding of all the runtime-defined definitions in your program
* `sorbet/rbi/todo.rbi`            Constants which weren't discovered in previous phases

NOTE: To do this, it will `require` ALL of your `.rb` files. This means if
you have any scripts which have top-level statements that aren't guarded by
a `if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` block, they will execute. If `srb init` takes a
long time or hangs, we suggest you `CTRL+C` and guard your script's
top-level statements with `if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` before re-running.

    # todo.rbi generation before they were ignored, we discovered the constants
    # that they defined and did not add the constants to todo.rbi file.
    #
    # Regenerating after one run of sigil suggestion will put those constants
    # into the todo.rbi file.

Completed successfully, yay!

This script has probably generated many changed files in ./sorbet/. Please commit them all.

Some possible next steps:
* Verify this script worked by running `srb tc`. It should say 'No errors!'.
* Go change a file from `typed: false` to `typed: true`, and then run `srb tc`.
  It should tell you some type errors. If you can fix those, please do and commit the changes.
* Write as much new code as you can with `typed: true` or higher.
* Turn your `typed: ignore` files into `typed: false` and see the errors. Try to fix those.
