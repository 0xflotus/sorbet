- always "the code", not "your code"
  - always "any problems", not "your problems"
  - prefer "we" to "you"
  - docs are a learning experience; no need to make it a matter of "Us vs Them"

- naming conventions:
  - Sorbet (capital S, no monospace) → the whole project / team
  - `sorbet` → *specifically* the static system / command line
  - `sorbet-runtime` → *specifically* the runtime system
